# Test Director Script

## Before running the test

**"Welcome to the test. This test requires you to do the same task as the actual pretest, in which you must respond to an alternating sequence of letters and numbers as quickly as you can. No breaks will be given during the test."**

**"As previously instructed, you will either have to press the SPACEBAR or will have to use the number pad on the RIGHT of the keyboard when providing input during the tasks. You CANNOT use the number pad at the TOP of the keyboard. During the tasks, anytime you are required to press the SPACEBAR, you MUST do so with your LEFT hand. When you are required to use the number pad, you MUST do so with your RIGHT hand. For any other key input that is asked of you, you may use either hand. During this test, you do NOT need to provide mouse input. It is critical that you do not click the mouse or move the mouse. If you wish for the mouse or cursor to be moved, ask me to move it BEFORE the test starts."**

**"You may quit this test at any time. If you choose to quit, your responses and data will not be recorded, and the test will be rendered invalid. To quit, ask me to end the test."**

**"We will soon start. You will first be shown 3 instructions once more, which reiterates the same procedure as the actual pretest which you have already completed. Once you understand the instructions, the test will immediately begin."**


## At test conclusion

**"Thank you for participating in the test. You may now take a break and ask any questions you may have. You may be asked to complete the test again at another time."**
