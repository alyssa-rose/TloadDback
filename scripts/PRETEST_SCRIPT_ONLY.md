# Test Director Script

## Before running the pretest
**"Welcome to the cognitive pretest. During this test, you will have to respond to characters on the 
screen using the keyboard. The characters will only be on the screen for a short, predetermined period of time. 
During the time that the character is on the screen, you must provide the correct input to the best of your ability. 
If you respond after the character has left the screen, your response will not be counted. Therefore, you must respond _AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE._"**

**"These characters will either be a letter or a number. The directions for how to respond to the characters will be provided to you as you progress through the tasks. However, I CAN inform you that you will either have to press the SPACEBAR or will have to use the number pad on the RIGHT of the keyboard when providing input during the tasks. You CANNOT use the number pad at the TOP of the keyboard. During the tasks, anytime you are required to press the SPACEBAR, you MUST do so with your LEFT hand. When you are required to use the number pad, you MUST do so with your RIGHT hand. For any other key input that is asked of you, you may use either hand. During this test, you do NOT need to provide mouse input. It is critical that you do not click the mouse or move the mouse. If you wish for the mouse or cursor to be moved, ask me to move it BEFORE a task starts."**

**"At predetermined times during the pretest, you will have time to take a break. During this time, you are allowed to rest for as long as you need to. It is highly encouraged that you take breaks when offered."**

**"You may quit this pretest at any time. If you choose to quit, your responses and data will not be recorded, and the pretest will be rendered invalid. If you quit during the pretest, you will NOT be able to progress to the actual test. To quit, ask me to end the pretest."**

**"We will soon start. The first 3 tasks are meant to help you understand what will be required of you before the actual pretest starts. When you reach the actual pretest, you will be required to wait for me to provide further instruction. The tasks will now start."**

## Before the actual pretest

**"You have now reached the actual pretest. This test is the exact same task as the letter and digits exercise you just completed. However, if you continue to maintain a high level of performance for each set of character sequences, the time that the characters appear on screen will gradually decrease. This means that you will have to respond to a character within a shorter timeframe. After completing a full character sequence, you will have the option to take a break. Just as before, it is encouraged that you take as long as you need to rest before starting another character sequence set. The pretest ends once too many mistakes have been made. To make sure this pretest is accurate, you must remain focused and respond as quickly as you can. If you understand this and are ready to begin, follow the instructions on screen. If you need to rest for longer, you may do so before starting.""**

## At pretest conclusion
**"Thank you for participating in the pretest. You will complete the actual test at another time. You may now take a break and ask any questions that you may have.""**
